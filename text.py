intro = f"""Welcome to Valorant.
        
Your team all got killed by the Ranked Demon Reyna on the enemy team, 
you need to clutch. 

The Reyna will certainly one tap you the second you get into an encounter so the only way you're going to win this is by picking up enough shields (total 300hp) to not instantly die. 

Shield orbs can be found randomly throughout the map, and add 50hp to your character. 

There is still enemy utility scattered around the map, each piece you encounter will deduct 30hp from your character. 

You also have an agent ability, which will hopefully give you an edge over this no-lifer. Using an ability does not pass your turn. 

You are on attack, so you have a time limit of 50 rounds to find and kill Reyna in order to win.

Remember, CLUTCH OR GAE!!
